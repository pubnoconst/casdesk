      <p id="termstext">
        I confirm, that a Casphone staff member has informed me, that the following device I purchase is a second hand, fully refurbished product.<br>
        I have inspected the item and agree it is in good working condition and functions without defect. It has been fully explained how to use the purchased device and I understand Casphone is not responsible for any problems that occur due to misuse of the product after the purchase.<br>
        I understand that if any problems occur after the purchase a service fee will be charged for inspection unless management deem otherwise.<br>
        I confirm that I am older than 16 years old, eligible to purchase and able to provide ID to confirm this. I understand and agree that this purchase comes with a 30-days warranty; any problems or defects outside this term will not be the responsibility of Casphone to fix. If a problem or defect is found in this 30-day period that is not due to misuse, I understand that Casphone will repair the problem within a 7 working day period or replace the item with another if available.<br>
        Casphone is not required to give a refund on this purchase.<br>
        This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Queensland and the Country of Australia.
